#**Notes** 
By *“good programming,”* we mean an approach to the creation of software that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from
the very beginning, at every stage, and for every step.
###Systematic program design
A program interacts with people, dubbed users, and other programs, in which case we speak of server and client components
In this context, “systematic program design” refers to a mix of two concepts: design recipes and iterative refinement.
Design Recipes apply to both complete programs and individual functions.
